# OptiMate

Optimate is a collection of libraries designed to help you optimize your AI models. It is an open-source project developed by Nebuly AI but is **not actively maintained**.

The tools available to assist you in your optimization are:

✅ [Speedster](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/optimate/tree/main/optimization/speedster): reduce inference costs by leveraging SOTA optimization techniques that best couple your AI models with the underlying hardware (GPUs and CPUs)

✅ [Nos](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nos): reduce infrastructure costs by leveraging real-time dynamic partitioning and elastic quotas to maximize the utilization of your Kubernetes GPU cluster

✅ [ChatLLaMA](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/optimate/tree/main/optimization/chatllama): reduce hardware and data costs by leveraging fine-tuning optimization techniques and RLHF alignment
